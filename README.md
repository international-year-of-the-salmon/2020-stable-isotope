## Hi there 👋

🙋 Welcome to the repository for the stable isotope data collected in the Gulf of Alaska in 2020 as part of the International Year of the Salmon High Seas Expedition.

🐟 The repository is structured as follows: 
  * `original_data` contains processed data files that have been sent to the IYS Data Scientists that have not been formatted to the IYS Data Template.
  * `standardized_data` contains the standardized data tables as they will be published to OBIS or ERDDAP. 
  * `scripts` contains the code used to format the data files from the `original_data` folder to the data tables as found in `standardized_data`.
  * `docs` contains any supplementary material, protocols, changelogs etc relevant for data interpretation.
